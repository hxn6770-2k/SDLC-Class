# SDLC - Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves a thorough understanding of the users' requirements and goals. This often starts by talking to users, conducting surveys, or doing research to gather insights and perspectives. By gathering this information, we can get a better understanding of what users need and how to build a program that meets those needs. 

In order to translate user needs into program implementation, "user stories" are used. As my understanding, user stories are simple and user-focused descriptions of what users want to achieve with the program. They help us prioritize tasks, communicate with the development team, and make sure everyone understands what needs to be done. User stories also help estimate the effort required, define clear expectations, and break down the work into smaller, manageable tasks.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When it comes to developing programs, using agile processes like Scrum can be helpful. In my opinion, Scrum is like a teamwork framework that focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and doing things step by step. It breaks the project into smaller parts called sprints, where the team works together and has quick meetings to stay updated. They also get feedback regularly to make sure everyone on the right track. By using Scrum, I believe that I can work better as a team, be more flexible when things change, and improve your development process over time.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development to me means working well with others and communicating effectively. It involves being committed to the team's success, being open to change, and taking responsibility for my tasks. It also means constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and treating others with respect and understanding.
